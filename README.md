## Key Features & Architecture

The application is built using a **Decoupled Architecture**, where the frontend (this repo) is entirely separate from the backend API.

### Role-Based Dashboards
The UI dynamically adapts based on the authenticated user's role:

- **Volunteer**: Tracks event enrollment, history, and downloads certificates.  
- **NGO**: Manages event creation, tracks volunteer applications, and monitors donations.  
- **Corporate**: Monitors financial contributions.  

### Multi-Step Authentication
Implements a secure login/signup flow where the user's existence is checked against the API before prompting for a password or registration details.
